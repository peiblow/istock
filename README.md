Using a **multithread** estrategy to run in parallel some tasks
Using **QUEUE** with **KAFKA** too, to be more performatic
So using queue i made some safe queue processing, if the message has an error it'll be sent to a **DLQ**

these tasks in a real world could be a LAMBDA and i should put them to running on parallel in that service
Just a ideia! :)
